1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

React makes building web apps easier by making everything into a small component that is easier to work on while working alone and working with a group.

2. What does it mean to think in react?

	To think in React, is to make sure that you build and style everything inside it's own component. Otherwise you could break your code, or you would be defeating the purpose of React.

3. Describe state.

	State is where our data comes from. You need to make the state as simple as possible and keep the number of stateful components to an absolute minimum.

4. Describe props.

	Props are the same thing as Stateful components, however, they are immutable. Props should only be used to pass data from the State.

5. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?

A side effect is when React isn't being used to render HTML.
Yo uwould have to use async rendering / await
